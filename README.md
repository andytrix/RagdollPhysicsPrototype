This prototype demonstrates character movement and physics modeling based on ragdoll mechanics. It is specifically designed for game developers who want to explore physics-driven character motion and fine-tuning using GML code. The prototype showcases how a physics-based character can interact with its environment in a realistic way, making it a valuable learning resource for those interested in game development with GameMaker.

*Note: This project is a prototype. If you choose to use this code, it's recommended to optimize and adapt it to better suit your specific requirements. The code serves as a foundational example, but further customization may be necessary for production use.*

# Features

- **Physics-Driven Movement**: The character's movement and interactions are based on physics calculations, providing realistic and dynamic behavior.
- **Ragdoll Mechanics**: Includes ragdoll elements that allow the character to respond naturally to collisions and forces.
- **Joint and Motor Control**: Configurable joint constraints and motorized movements enable precise control over limb articulation.
- **Customizable Settings**: Physics properties such as friction, damping, and restitution can be adjusted to fine-tune character behavior.
- **GML Implementation**: Written entirely in GameMaker Language (GML), making it suitable for GameMaker projects and easy to integrate.
